# battery-voltage-report
When run, it shows the 3 voltage leves the calculator will read to determine the battery percentage.
If I get enough data, I can reconstruct an approximate voltage curve for the calculator's battery and display the battery percentage better than with 25% accuracy, which the OS does not.
